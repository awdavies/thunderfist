This uses BeautifulSoup.  All of the copyright info is inside of the included python file.  I take no credit for any of the wonderful parsing functionality added by said file.

TEST RUN
--------

This script appears to function on flat directories with one c file.  An example config is included.  To run do, do the following (for python2.7):

    python grader.py -D EX0_DIR -c ex0test.cfg > GRADER_OUT

And <code>GRADER_OUT</code> will contain the output of the grading attempts.
